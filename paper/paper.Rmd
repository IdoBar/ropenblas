<!-- The `ropenblas` package aims to facilitate the day-to-day life of R programmers who want more performance on GNU/Linux systems, without removing the possibility that specific configurations are made, if they deem convenient, that is, more technical users will be able to pass other flags that will be considered in the compilation process. Through the package's `ropenblas()` and `rcompiler()` functions, the library user will be able to compile and link the R language in his GNU/Linux distribution with the OpenBLAS library, all within R and in a very simple fashion. All functions work without being influenced by the GNU/Linux distribution and are independent of their repositories, that is, it does not matter which GNU/Linux distribution is being used. Linking the OpenBLAS library to R will bring better computational performance to the language in the most diverse algebraic operations commonly used in areas such as statistics, data science, and machine learning. -->

The `ropenblas` package provides improved performance on GNU/Linux systems and allows for passing additional compilation flags for more technical users. Through the `ropenblas()` and `rcompiler()` functions, the user will be able to compile and link the GNU/Linux distribution R language with the OpenBLAS library, all within R and in a very simple fashion. It works for all GNU/Linux distributions. Linking the OpenBLAS library to R brings better computational performance to the language in the most diverse algebraic operations commonly used in areas such as statistics, data science, and machine learning.

<!-- # Statement of Need -->

<!-- The `ropenblas` package aims to allow algebraic computing of R to be performed using the OpenBLAS library, that is, it allows easy linking of R to the OpenBLAS library on GNU/Linux systems without depending on the distribution repositories. This will allow several researchers in the areas of statistics, data science, and machine learning to take advantage of more efficient performance in algebraic calculations, for example, multiplication, factorization, and matrix inversion. The `ropenblas` library, version 0.2.9 will also allow the R programmer to have, in his GNU/Linux distribution, several compiled versions of the R language giving the possibility to easily switch between these versions, this being an Open Source functionality that is only possible in some commercial IDEs of R. All this is done within the R language, minimizing the chance of less experienced users to break their operating system by running several instructions that are not perfectly understood. -->

<!-- The fact that the `ropenblas` package does not depend on the repositories of the GNU/Linux distribution will allow that in more stable distributions the R programmer will have at his disposal the most recent version of the OpenBLAS libraries and the R language. Everything is done safely, since the `ropenblas` package uses the stable versions of the official development repositories of the OpenBLAS library and the R programming language, respectively. Until the present version, the package has more than 11000 downloads, having an average of more than 1000 downloads in the month before the date of this submission, based on the official R language repositories. -->

# Introduction

<!-- The term "computational efficiency" is very common for those who program statistical methods, in which a large part of them involve algebraic operations that are often reproduced in computationally intensive simulations, such as Monte-Carlo simulations - MC and resampling methods, as is the case with bootstrap resampling. Statistics is just one example within so many other areas that need performance and uses the R language. -->

Computational efficiency is important for those who program statistical methods since they often involve algebraic operations reproduced in computationally intensive simulations, such as Monte-Carlo simulations and resampling methods, as is the case with bootstrap resampling. Statistics is just one example within other areas that need good performance and use the R language.

In addition to the adoption of good programming practices and the maximum, efficient and adequate use of available computational resources, such as code parallelization, through multicore parallelism procedures allowed by most current processors and operating systems, small adjustments and linkage of libraries can provide useful benefits.

<!-- The `ropenblas` package aims to provide useful and simple experiences to R [@R] programmers who develop their activities on GNU/Linux operating systems. These experiences consist of being able to link any version of the OpenBLAS [@openblas] library to the R language, as well as allowing the programmer to install and link various versions of R and make them available on their operating system as well as switch between these versions as they see fit. -->

The `ropenblas` package aims to be easy to use for R [@R] programmers who work on GNU/Linux operating systems. For example, a user can link any version of the OpenBLAS [@openblas] library to the R language and install and link various versions of R to make them available on their operating system as well as switch between these versions.

Linking the R language to the OpenBLAS library can bring several benefits to algebraic computing in R. OpenBLAS is an Open-Source implementation of the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms - BLAS library that is often the first library option for algebraic computing to be linked in the installation of R on many GNU/Linux distributions. The OpenBLAS library is available at <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS> and adds optimized implementations of linear algebra kernels that can run optimized on various processor architectures. OpenBLAS is based on the GotoBLAS2 project code in version 1.13 [@gotoblas2], code available under the terms of the BSD license.

<!-- The functions of the `ropenblas` package can help the R language user to make this link without leaving the R promprt, as well as allowing the user to choose the version of OpenBLAS to be considered, the last stable version being considered by default . Everything is accomplished by functions without many arguments and without major complications to be used. These functions can be very comforting for users of R on GNU/Linux systems who do not feel safe to run several codes in a terminal that runs Shell Script codes for the language configuration. -->

<!-- It is very common to see users of R in distributions with repositories not prone to immediate updates of programs using several tutorials found in communities on the internet suggesting several lines of code and steps that can be potentially dangerous or easy to be misunderstood by many users of R language. Being able to compile, enable resources if necessary and switch between versions of R using simple functions to be used and without leaving the command pompt of the R language is attractive. -->

<!-- # General package information -->

The `ropenblas` is a package designed to facilitate the linking of the library OpenBLAS with the language R. The package, which works only for Linux systems, will automatically download the latest source code from the OpenBLAS library and compile the code. The package will automatically bind the language R, through the `ropenblas()` function, to use the OpenBLAS library. Everything will be done automatically regardless of the Linux distribution you are using. Enumerating some advantages of the package:

1.  Everything is done within the R language;
2.  The procedure (use of functions) will be the same for any Linux distribution;
3.  The OpenBLAS library will be compiled and you will choose which build version to bind to R, regardless of your Linux distribution;
4.  The package allows you to install R $\geq 3.1.0$, also allowing you to install one more version, in addition to allowing you to easily switch between those versions;
5.  The linked versions of R will continue to be recognized by their Integrated Development Environment - IDE and nothing will have to be adjusted in your GNU/Linux distribution after using any function of the package;
6.  Unnecessary builds will be avoided. Therefore, if you need to switch between compiled versions of the R language, the use of binaries compiled compiled previously will be suggested;
7.  If any errors occur, the functions of the package will not damage the previous installation of the language;
8.  If something better can be done or if a newer version of what you want to install (R or OpenBLAS) exists, the functions will automatically suggest that you should consider installing newer versions.

The `ropenblas` package is already available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network - CRAN, currently in version 0.2.9, and the project is maintained on GitHub at <https://github.com/prdm0/ropenblas> where contributors can find other details of the code, information, as well as being able to contribute with the development of the project. On the website, it is also possible to read the `NEWS.md` file with details of the versions and the focus of the current development. The site is deposited at <https://prdm0.github.io/ropenblas/>. Suggestions for improvements and bug reports can be sent via the link <https://github.com/prdm0/ropenblas/issues>. You can find out how to contribute to the package by accessing the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file at <https://github.com/prdm0/ropenblas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>.

```

<!-- You can also specify older versions of the OpenBLAS library. Automatically, if no version is specified, the `ropenblas` package will consider the latest version of the library OpenBLAS.  -->

<!-- Considering using the OpenBLAS library rather than the BLAS may bring extra optimizations for your code and improved computational performance for your simulations, since OpenBLAS is an optimized implementation of the library BLAS. -->

<!-- Some of the reasons why it is convenient to link R language to the use of BLAS optimized alternatives can be found here. Several other benchmarks that point to improved computing performance by considering the library OpenBLAS can be found on the internet. -->

<!-- The `ropenblas` package, by `rcompiler()` function is also useful if you want to install different versions of the R language. The different versions, specified by the user of the R language, will be compiled and will also be linked to the OpenBLAS library. If you want to switch between compiled versions of the R language, no compilation is needed anymore. This allows you to avoid having to get your hands dirty with tedious operating system settings, regardless of your GNU/Linux distribution. Another great use of the `rcompiler()` function is that you will not be dependent on updating your GNU/Linux distribution repositories and you can always have the latest version of the R language. -->

<!-- The use of the `ropenblas` package will return warnings that help you proceed with the use of the functions. If your internet is not working or if any dependency on the operating system is not present, the package will let you know. -->

<!-- # Dependencies -->

<!-- In addition to dependencies in the form of other packages deposited with CRAN, the `ropenblas` package depends on external dependencies that are normally installed or are easily installed on any GNU/Linux distribution. Are they: -->

<!--   1. **GNU Make**: GNU Make utility to maintain groups of programs;  -->

<!--   2. **GNU GCC Compiler (C and Fortran)**: The GNU Compiler Collection - C and Fortran frontends. -->

<!-- These programs that are described in `SystemRequirements` in the package's `DESCRIPTION` file are essential for compiling the OpenBLAS library and the R language. The functions of the `ropenblas` package are designed to identify the lack of these dependencies external to CRAN, informing the package user which dependencies are missing and suggesting that they should be installed. The other dependencies indexed to CRAN are described in `Imports` in the file  `DESCRIPTION`. These will be installed automatically. -->

<!-- Other warnings can also be suggested, such as, for example, a problem with the internet connection. All warnings are given very clearly so that the user has no doubts about the problem that may be occurring. -->

# Brief explanation

<!-- # Installation -->

<!-- The `ropenblas` package can be installed in two ways. The first is using the `install.packages()` function of the `utils` package which is available in any basic language installation and the second is using the `devtools` package which will allow the package to be installed directly from the development directory on GitHub. -->

<!-- All code kept in the master branch of the package project on GitHub can be installed, since there will only be codes that are working properly and ready to use. The two forms of installation follow: -->

<!--   1. `install.packages("ropenblas")`: for installing the package available at CRAN; -->

<!--   2. `devtools::install_github(repo = "prdm0/ropenblas, ref = "master", force = TRUE)`: for installing the package from the project development directory on GitHub. -->

<!-- # Exported functions and usage -->

The `ropenblas` library exports six functions for use which are the `rcompiler()`, `ropenblas()`, `last_version_r()`, `last_version_openblas()`, `link_again()` and `rnews()`. All of them are very simple to use and have few arguments that are sufficient to maintain the flexibility of use. Also, functions like `rcompiler()` and `ropenblas()` do not return content or data structures that are of any practical use. What these functions do is configure the GNU/Linux system to use R, configure different versions of the language, switch between versions, and link with the OpenBLAS library. It is also possible to obtain a summary of the versions of R and the OpenBLAS library that are available.

Table 1 below presents the benefit of considering an optimized version of BLAS. Computational costs are presented in the calculation of the singular decomposition in a rectangular matrix (`svd()` function) and in the calculation of the inverse of that same matrix (`solve()` function). Some repetitions (100 repetitions) of each of the respective functions were performed. The benchmark can be better observed through the violin plots shown in Figure 2.

| Functions  | Library  | Time (seconds) |
|------------|----------|:--------------:|
| `svd(x)`   | BLAS     |     6.520      |
| `svd(x)`   | OpenBLAS |     0.641      |
| `solve(x)` | BLAS     |     1.640      |
| `solve(x)` | OpenBLAS |     0.640      |

: Comparison of the computational costs of the `svd()` and `solve()` functions (average of 100 repetitions).

Through a benchmark it is possible to better understand the performance gain that can be achieved by linking the R language to the OpenBLAS library. Figure 2 presents the benchmarks in the form of a violin plot, in which 100 reproductions of the `svd(X)` expression were considered, in the form of the code above, with the R linked to the BLAS library and linked to the OpenBLAS library, respectively, on the same hardware. It was observed that the average time of execution of the routine `svd(X)` considering the OpenBLAS library was less than 10 times the time necessary to execute it in R linking to a non-optimized version of BLAS, being the average time of 0.64 and 6.52 seconds, respectively.

```

<!-- ## 'link_again' function -->

<!-- The `link_again()` function links again the OpenBLAS library with the R language, being useful to correct problems of untying the OpenBLAS library that is common when the operating system is updated. The function can link again the R language with the OpenBLAS library. -->

<!-- Thus, `link_again()` will only make the linkage when in some previous section of R the `ropenblas()` function has been used for the initial binding of the R language with the OpenBLAS library. -->

<!-- The use of the function is quite simple, just by running the code `link_again()` since the function has no arguments. It will automatically detect if there was a link break that will be rebuilt again without the need for any compilation. From time to time, after a major update of the operating system, it may be convenient to run the `link_again()` function. Link breakage rarely occurs, but if it does, it can be resolved quickly. The following code and image exemplify a possible reconstruction of symbolic links using the `link_again()` function: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=TRUE} -->

<!-- link_again() -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="If an unlinking of the OpenBLAS library occurs, the function will re-link the library.", out.width="100%"} -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics("link_again_01.png") -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Running the `link_again()` function in a situation where there is no need will not generate problems. The function will return the message that everything is linked correctly, according to the code and image that follows: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="If relinking is not required, the function will make it clear.", out.width="100%"} -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics("link_again_02.png") -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## 'rnews function' -->

<!-- The `rnews()` function returns the contents of the `NEWS.html` file in the standard browser installed on the operating system. The `NEWS.html` file contains the main changes from the recently released versions of the R language. The goal is to facilitate the query by invoking it directly from the R command prompt. -->

<!-- The `rnews()` function is analogous to the news function of the `utils` package. However, using the news command in a terminal style bash shell is possible to receive a message like: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->

<!-- news() -->

<!-- ## starting httpd help server ... done -->

<!-- ## Error in browseURL(url): 'browser' must be a non-empty character string -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- If `pdf = FALSE` (default), the `NEWS.html` file will open in the browser, otherwise `NEWS.pdf` will be opened. If `dev = FALSE` (default), it will not show changes made to the language development version. To see changes in the development version, do `dev = TRUE`. -->

# Improvements

The package will continue to evolve and code reviews will always be carried out. In addition, contributions to the development of the package are always welcome, especially those that aim to allow the `rcompiler()` and `ropenblas()` functions to work on Windows systems. There is also an interest that the `ropenblas` package will allow the linking of the Intel Math Kernel Library - MKL, just as it is done with the OpenBLAS library. All of these are improvements that we would like to see in future versions of the package.
